# What does this do?
This project houses the core APIs for a suite of tools on documentation based on Swagger.

# Why do this
I work at [Replex](replex.io) (shameless plug here) and I got tired of getting tickets to update the swagger documentation which isn't easy or also extremely fun to do.

So whilst creating a simple handler to record the requests, I started this project.

# What can I do with this?
Like every core API project, this is not usable by you.

It's a base package consumed by other projects which inherit functionality from here.

# I found a bug, how can I contribute?
